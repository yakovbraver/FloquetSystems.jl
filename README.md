# FloquetSystems.jl

A package for studying quantum Floquet systems.

Current functionality:

* Calculation of quasienergy spectrum for a driven Boseâ€“Hubbard model on a square lattice (1D, 2D): exactly (via the stroboscopic evolution operator); using van Vleck high-frequency expansion [[1]][Eckardt2015]; using DPT and EDPT [[2]][Braver2024].

For usage examples, see the `examples` folder.
